    <P><li>To make the smoked sausage and potatoes recipe: In a large cast-iron skillet, heat 3 tablespoons of oil over medium heat. Add the baby potatoes to the pan and season with salt and pepper. Saute until golden and cooked through, around 10-12 minutes, stirring regularly. Transfer potatoes to a plate and set aside.</li></P>
    <P><li> In the same skillet with the remaining tablespoon oil, brown the sliced smoked sausage on all sides for around 5 minutes over medium heat. Add garlic, onion, and red bell pepper and season with red pepper flakes, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Cook smoked sausage for 2 to 3 minutes until softened. Deglaze with 1/4 cup stock, stir in the hot sauce and stir to coat the smoked sausage and veggies.</li></P>
    <P><li>Add the sauteed potatoes back to the skillet and mix everything together to reheat the potatoes. Adjust seasoning, garnish with chopped fresh parsley and serve the smoked sausage and potatoes immediately with parmesan. Enjoy!</li></P>
